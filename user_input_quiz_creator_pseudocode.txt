Quiz Creator

Pseudocode:
1. Create a menu setup that presents options for user to "Add Question", "Remove Question", "View Question", and "Exit".
2. Prompt the user to input choices in the created menu with the use of while loop so that the program will run
continuously until the user chooses to exit.
3. Define a function in which when the user chooses to "Add Questions", it will ask for the user to write a question,
write a four answer choices (a, b, c, d) and the correct answer. Make sure to store the input into a .txt file. Output
of the file must be clear and in an organized format.
    Example:
    Question: How many legs does a dog have?
    a) 1
    b) 2
    c) 3
    d) 4
    Correct answer: d
4. Define a function in which when the user chooses "Remove Question", it will load all the saved questions stored from
the file, it will display a number, ask the user a number to delete the question, and update the file without the removed
question.
5. Define a function in which when the user chooses "View Questions", it will load all the questions and display them in
a numbered list for organization. (Ex. [0] How many legs does a dog have?)
6. Once the user chooses to "Exit", display a message and eng the program.
7. Use libraries for more engaging experience such as colorama. Add as well an os.path to check if the quiz file exist
before trying to delete or load anything.
